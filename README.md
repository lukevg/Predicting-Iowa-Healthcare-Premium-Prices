# Predicting-Iowa-Healthcare-Premium-Prices

For this project, I downloaded data from the State of Iowa about Affordable Care Act compliant healthcare plans available in different parts of the state, and merged it with county level economic and demographic data gathered from the US census. 

I then used variables from the merged dataset to predict healthcare premium prices using the three types of linear regression models. 

I have included a notebook with my modeling results, and another with my data cleaning and some initial exploratory analysis. The PowerPoint presentation summarizes the project, and a blog article further explaining the process can be found in my blog repo.
